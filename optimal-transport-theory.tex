\chapter{Fundamentals of Optimal Transport}

This chapter focuses on presenting some of the fundamentals of Optimal Transport Theory.
Many current applications of Optimal Transport are related to the use of OT based metrics, such
as the Wasserstein distance. Thus, we start this chapter with the basic notions of Optimal
Transport, proving some results related to existence and duality, and we finish with
an introduction to the Wasserstein distance. After finishing this chapter, one can already
comprehend many of the applications in, for example, the field of Machine Learning.
