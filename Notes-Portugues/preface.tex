The field of Optimal Transport has grown quite substantially in recent years
\footnote{\citet{villani2008optimal} is roughly a thousand pages of theoretical results on OT.},
and going through the theory in order understand how it can be applied to real world problems can
be a challenging task for researchers not acquainted with the field.
Hence, we have filtered the main theoretical
results necessary for mathematically inclined researchers that are interested in learning
Optimal Transport.

These notes are mainly based on the book
``Optimal Transport for Applied Mathematicians'' by
\citet{santambrogio2015optimal}. We do not focus
on proving the measurability of the sets, functions and maps, although it can be indeed shown
that the ones presented here are indeed measurable.

As prerequisites to properly understand this text, we advise some knowledge of
Measure Theory and Functional Analysis. Although, we've tried to either prove or state
all the necessary results.
