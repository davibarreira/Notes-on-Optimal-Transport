On the left, there is a large overlap between the two distributions, but a large geometrical distance for a portion. On the right, there is much less overlap, but the whole distribution is geometrically closer. These two cases clearly highlight how $W_p$ incorporates geometrical information while $KL$ doesn't.}}{35}{figure.1.5}%
